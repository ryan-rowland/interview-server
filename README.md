#Quick Chat Server

## Description
QuickChat is a simple WebSocket implementation that relays messages between connected clients, storing up to the 10 most recent messages for each conversation.

## API

### Sending a Command
The WebSocket server expects to receive a UTF8-encoded stringified JSON payload, specifying the <String>command, <Number>reqId and <Object>args parameters. The reqId (request ID) field is set by the client and is used to identify which request a subsequent response is for. The server expects the first request to be `reqId=1` and every subsequent request to be `reqId+=1`, regardless of success or failure.

The server will then send a Response as a UTF8-encoded stringified JSON payload of type `response`, containing a reqId to track which request it is responding to, a statusCode of `[200, 400, 401]` reflecting the result of the request using HTTP status codes and a body containing any relevant human-readable error message if applicable.

For example:
```
{
  type: 'response',
  reqId: 1,
  statusCode: 200,
  body: null
}
```

##### Accepted Commands

Command | Arguments | Description
--------|-----------|------------
get-messages | N/A | Request a list of URI-encoded messages the server knows about (The server stores up to the 10 most recent).
join-conversation | String displayName, String conversationId | Joins the client to the specified conversation, as the specified alias. Will create a new room if one does not exist.
send-message | String text | Sends a message to the client's active conversation.

##### Examples
```
{
  command: 'join-conversation',
  reqId: 1,
  args: {
    displayName: 'Alice',
    conversationId: 'myConversation'
  }
}
```

```
{
  command: 'get-messages',
  reqId: 2,
  args: { }
}
```

```
{
  command: 'send-message',
  reqId: 3,
  args: {
    text: 'Hello World!'
  }
}
```
 
### Receiving an Event
The WebSocket server sends periodic updates, using events. An event is a UTF-8 encoded stringified JSON payload of type `event`, containing the <String>name and <String>data properties.

##### Events

Type | Body Contains | Description
-----|---------------|------------
member-joined | String name | A new client has connected to the active conversation. This will also be sent to a client once for every existing member in the conversation it is joining.
member-left | String name | A member has left the conversation.
message-list | String messageList | A response to the client's request for a list of known messages. The list is a single string containing a comma-separated list of URI encoded messages.
new-message | String message | A new message has been added to the active conversation. Message is URI encoded.

##### Examples


```
{
  type: 'event',
  name: 'member-joined',
  data: 'Alice'
}
```

```
{
  type: 'event',
  name: 'new-message',
  data: 'Alice: Hello World!'
}
```

```
{
  type: 'event',
  name: 'member-left',
  data: 'Alice'
}
```

```
{
  type: 'event',
  name: 'message-list',
  data: 'Bob%3A%20Hello!,Bob%3A%20Is%20anybody%20here%3F'
}
```

```
{
  type: 'event',
  name: 'new-message',
  data: 'Alice%3A%20Hello%20World!'
}
```

## Additional Functionality
These features are not used for the basic exercise. If the exercise is completed early, implementing these features into the client is a stretch goal.

#### Additional Commands
These commands also currently exist on the server:

Command | Arguments | Description
--------|-----------|------------
authenticate | String jwt | A signed JWT token string containing permission flags.
remove-member | String name | Removed a specific member from the active conversation. Requires admin permissions.

##### Examples
```
{
  command: 'authenticate',
  reqId: 1,
  args: {
    jwt: 'ABC.XYZ.123'
  }
}
```

```
{
  command: 'remove-member',
  reqId: 2,
  args: {
    name: 'Alice'
  }
}
```

##### JWT Authentication
To authenticate for admin power, the server takes a signed JWT token (SHA 256). The secret used to sign the JWT token is `dr4w-th3-0wl`. The payload of the token should contain the permissions granted to the user. In this case, our only permission is `admin`. Hence, the payload to authenticate as admin would look like this:

```
{
  admin: true
}
```
